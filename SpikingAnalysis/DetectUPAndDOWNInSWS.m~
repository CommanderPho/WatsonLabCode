% Finds "ON" and "OFF" intervals during SWS, with intention of relating to
% UP/DOWN states.  However this alorhithm is purely based on spiking: OFF
% periods are 50+ms of no spiking, ON periods are 50-4000ms, have at least
% 10 spikes... (may later want to make su rit is flanked by OFFs)
%
% Inputs
% spikestsd = tsdarray of all spikes from all cells in a dataset
% intervals = a 6 element cell array of all intervalarrays, with cell
%           component {3} being SWS intervals
%
% Outputs
% UPs and DNs are each intervalsets (tstoolbox), each interval in the set
% is an UP state or DOWN state interval, with timestamps at 10000hz, like tsdata
% (Could also output ONs and OFFs, which are based only on spiking, not
% cross validated with delta waves)
%
% OFFs - simple offs within the spans specified (50-1250ms)
% ONs - simple inversion of offs
% DNs - OFFs with low gamma too
% UPs - ONs following a DN and stopped by any OFF
% % % gUPs - UPs where start is based on gamma increase above threshold
